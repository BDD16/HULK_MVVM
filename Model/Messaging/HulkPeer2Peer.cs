     //Future would like to implement friend Zones.  IE your friend circle is closed off from others who have the app, therefore they cannot access certain friend zones
     //in a more open setting a person is looked up via other friends in your circle for a quick six degrees of freedom lookup, if they cannot find the friend then it is assumed
     //that they do not have the app installed or they are currently logged off.  Will need to think more into this of making a peer to peer topology without a central server (how will this work?, how can this work?)
     //will need to do research into the "Decentralized Movement" could have open source into the topic already else will need to write original code
